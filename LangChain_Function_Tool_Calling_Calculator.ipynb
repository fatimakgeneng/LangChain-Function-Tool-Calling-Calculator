You could also think of it as 25 doubled (50) and then doubled again (100).  Multiplication is the inverse operation of division, and understanding both is crucial for grasping many mathematical concepts.  This calculation is also easily visualized â€“ imagine four rows of 25 objects each; counting them all would yield 100.  I can handle more intricate multiplication problems too, or any other mathematical operation you might have in mind.\n",
